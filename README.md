# Data Science Challenge - Predicting User Activity

:trophy: **3rd Place**

## About the challenge
A typical Data Science project involves multiple phases, including identifying business opportunities,
formalizing the problem, gathering and processing data, developing and training the model, and
integrating the solution into a production environment. For this assignment, we have defined the
problem and prepared the data, and your task is to develop a model that will use the available data to
solve the task and provide relevant predictions.

In this task, we will focus on users who have previously played Top Eleven and decided to return by
reinstalling the game. These users, who had played the game before but stopped at some point, are
referred to as "re-registrations" when they return to the game. By analyzing their data on the day they
re-register (registration_data_training.csv), along with data from their ‚Äúprevious lives‚Äù
(previous_lives_training_data.csv), we can discover ways to enhance their gaming experience - note
that some users may have had more than one previous life.

Information about their previous lives, along with their interactions on the day they re-registered,
provides important insights into the behavior of these re-registered users. With this data, we can make
more accurate predictions about their future behavior, allowing us to create personalized experiences
and content tailored specifically to them. This type of analysis is important for identifying users who
have shown they can be active, which helps us understand their needs and expectations better.

## Data description
There are four datasets:

‚óè previous_lives_training_data.csv

‚óè registration_data_training.csv

‚óè previous_lives_test_data.csv

‚óè registration_data_test.csv (similar as training dataset, but without target variable)

You can find the variable descriptions below. Some variables are present in both datasets (registration
data and previous lives dataset):

## Target variable
Target variable, days_active_first_28_days_after_registration, is an integer ranging from 0 to 28. It
represents the number of days a user was active during the first 28 days after re-registration date. A
value 0 indicates that the user didn‚Äôt log in at all during this period, while a value of 28 indicates that
the user was active every day within the 28-day period after re-registration.

## EVALUATION
What is your goal?üéØ
It is your job to predict the number of days a user will be active in the first 28 days after re-registration
for each user (identified by user_id) in the test datasets.

## Metricüìâ
Submissions are evaluated based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the predicted number
of days a user will be active in the first 28 days after re-registration and the actual number of days the
user was active.

## Submission formatüìÉ
You should save your results in the ‚Äúdays_active_first_28_days_after_registration_predictions.csv‚Äù file.
The submission file should contain a row for each user in the test dataset and 2 columns: user_id and
predicted_days_active_first_28_days_after_registration
